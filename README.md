# CMDb
CMDb is a Windows CMD.exe alternative,because sometimes cmd.exe doesn't work!
How to install:
Extract the 7z file with 7-Zip.
Run the installer script as admin (make sure you extracted the 7z in the desktop,and in the CMDb folder!)
Run CMDb1.9.9.exe and you're done!

Note for legacy version:The legacy executable is CMDb1.9.9legacy.exe,and to install the legacy version,do the same installation steps above,-
but launch the legacy executable.
